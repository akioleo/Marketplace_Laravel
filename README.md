## Development

This section is completely optional. For big projects, the developement strategies are not discussed. But for small projects, you can give some insight to people. It has 2 benefits in my opinion:

1. It's a way to give back to the community. People get to learn from you and appreciate your work
2. You can refer the README in future as a quick refresher before an interview or for an old project to check if it can help you in your currect work

### Part 1: Heading

#### Step 1: Subheading

* Mention the steps here
  * You can also have nested steps to break a step into small tasks
  
#### Step 2: Subheading

* Mention the steps here.
